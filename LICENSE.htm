 * ONS General Modules Bundle
 * -----------------------------------------
 * Description:
 *    This JavaScript bundle is generated via Webpack and combines all
 *    common front‑end modules used across the ONS Dashboard. It includes:
 *
 *      • Device restriction handling for responsive security/UI lockouts
 *      • Dynamic Bootstrap modal loader:
 *          - Fetches modal HTML fragments from the server via AJAX
 *          - Injects them into #dynamic-modal-container
 *          - Displays them using Bootstrap’s Modal API
 *      • Idle time detection with configurable inactivity warning & auto‑logout
 *      • Profile tabs heading management
 *      • Sidebar toggle & layout adjustment logic
 *      • Scroll‑to‑top visibility & animation
 *      • Theme toggler (light/dark/custom theme support)
 *      • Password visibility toggler
 *
 * Global API:
 *    All key initializers and utilities are exposed via the global:
 *
 *        window.GeneralAPI = {
 *            initDeviceRestriction,
 *            loadAndShowModal,
 *            initGModalLoader,
 *            initIdleTimeCounter,
 *            initPasswordToggler,
 *            initProfileTabs,
 *            initScrollToTop,
 *            initThemeToggler,
 *            initSidebar
 *        };
 *
 * Build Info:
 *    - Compiled & minified by Webpack from multiple ES module sources
 *    - Designed for inclusion as a single <script> on the dashboard and
 *      accessible both inline (onclick) and via JS.
 *
 * Usage:
 *    HTML trigger example:
 *        <button onclick="GeneralAPI.loadAndShowModal('break_timer_modal')">
 *            Open Break Timer
 *        </button>
